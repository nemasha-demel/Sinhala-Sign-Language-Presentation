## Introduction

Our research project that aims to bridge communication gaps for the deaf and hard of hearing communities by converting natural language into animated sign language presentations. The system uses NLP techniques for language parsing and gesture generation.

Features:

- Input: Text or Speech
- Output:Sign language presentation
- Modular architecture for NLP, Sign Mapping

## System Overview

1. **Preprocessing**: Cleans and segments the input text or transcribes speech.
2. **Language Understanding**: Uses POS tagging and syntax parsing to understand grammar.
3. **Sign Mapping**: Maps words/phrases to sign language gestures using a custom dictionary.
